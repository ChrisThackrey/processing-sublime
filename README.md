## Acknowledgements
- This bundle is very much based on [Processing TextMate Bundle by Leon Hong](http://www.onebitwonder.com/projects/processing/), thanks for all the good work!
- I used the [textmate-to-sublime-converter](https://github.com/srbs/textmate-to-sublime-converter) to convert the snippets from the original Processing TextMate Bundle to Sublime Text speak.
- My contribution is only the buildsystem and that finally someone did it :)
